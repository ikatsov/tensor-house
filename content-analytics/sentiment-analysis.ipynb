    "# Sentiment Analysis Using Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to perform classification of user-generated content (e.g. product reviews) using transformers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case\n",
    "We have a lage amount of user-generated content such as product reviews, call transcripts, or social media posts. We want to create a model that assigns labels to individual content items. For example, movie reviews can be assigned with `positive` and `negative` sentiment labels. We assume that we have a significant amount of labeled training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prototype: Data and Limitations\n",
    "We implement the sentiment classification model using a transformer that is trained from scratch on a labeled dataset. The implementation is based on [1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the IMDB dataset that contain 25,000 movies reviews from IMDB, labeled by sentiment (positive/negative). The dataset is automatically downloaded using Keras repository.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage and Productization\n",
    "This prototype can be used to evaluate how well a model trained from scratch can perform a given text classification task. The default dataset can be easily replaced with custom labeled dataset that contains enough training samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, one would typically use a pretrained model or LLM service to perform sentiment analysis and other text classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
