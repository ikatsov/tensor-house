    "# Supply Chain Control Center\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a prototype of a supply chain control application with a conversational interface. The application has access to several tools (APIs) such as relational inventory database, demand forecasting, and shipping cost estimation services. The user specifies a task to be performed or question to be answered in natural language, and the application writes a python script that calls the APIs, processes the fetched data, and prints the solution or answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The application is designed as a chain of LLM calls that starts with a high-level reasoning (planning) about the posed questions and gradually elaborate the solution until the final script is obtained. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Stage 1: Question\n",
    "What are the properties of supplier LA Shoes Inc?\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage 2: Logic\n",
    "1. Invoke search_documents passing the question \"What are the properties of supplier LA Shoes Inc?\" as an argument.\n",
    "2. Print the result returned by the searcher using the print_answer function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage 3: Python script\n",
    "# Delegate the question to the document searcher\n",
    "supplier_properties = search_documents(\"What are the properties of supplier LA Shoes Inc?\")\n",
    "# Generate the final answer\n",
    "print_answer(supplier_properties)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The application is implemented using the `streamlit` and `langchain` frameworks. See [1] for more examples of how LLMs can be used in supply chain management and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "The application uses Microsoft Azure LLM APIs by default. Edit `utilities.py` to switch to a different LLM provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Configure your LLM API providers, keys, and model names in `config.json` \n",
    "2. To start the application, run the following command in the `control_center_llm` folder:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python -m streamlit run sc_control_center_app.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Once the application started, open the URL logged in the terminal in your browser\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example Questions\n",
    "* What will be the demand for SKU 11001 in each location for each of 5 weeks?\n",
    "* Do we expect shortages of SKU 11001 in any locations over next 10 weeks?\n",
