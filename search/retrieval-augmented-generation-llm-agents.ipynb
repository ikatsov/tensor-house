    "# Retrieval-augmented Generation Using Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to retrieve the information from external systems (APIs) using LLM agents. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case\n",
    "We have external APIs that can be used to fetch or lookup relevant information based on keywords. We want to build a system that receives a natural language question, translates it into API calls, executes calls handling exceptions and incomplete results, and formulates the final answer based on the received information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prototype: Approach and Data\n",
    "We create a basic prototype that uses the ReAct framework to accomplish the retrieval task. We use the standard implementation integrated with Wikipedia search API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage and Productization\n",
    "Productization would require to implement custom API integrations and more robust error handling."
